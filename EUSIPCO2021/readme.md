7# Phase Reconstruction for Artificial Bandwidth Extension toward Musical Instrument Sound Signal

# Description:
This work performs a phase reconstruction method for artificail bandwidth extension toward a musical instrument sound signal.

# Abstract
We propose a phase reconstruction method for an artificial bandwidth extension (ABE) approach toward a musical instrument sound signal. The ABE approach reconstructs the missing upper bandwidth of 3400–8000 Hz (UB) from the existing narrow bandwidth of 300–3400 Hz (NB). The proposed method reconstructs the missing UB phase spectrum based on the short- time Fourier Transform phase improvement (STFTPI) approach that emphasizes a harmonic structure. The STFTPI approach is sensitive to the slight fundamental frequency estimation error, and thus we correct the estimated fundamental frequency using the existing NB phase difference. Besides, the proposed method discriminates whether the UB harmonic should be emphasized using the relation between the amplitude spectrum of the UB harmonic and that of the frequencies adjacent to the UB harmonic. The Experimental results show that the proposed method enhances the audio signal quality to accurately reconstruct the missing UB harmonic structure.
